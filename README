NAME
    Net::ValidMX - PERL Module to use DNS to verify if an email address
    could be valid.

SYNOPSIS
    Net::ValidMX - What I wanted was the ability to use DNS to verify if an
    email address COULD be valid. This could be used for sender verification
    with programs such as MIMEDefang or for websites to verify email
    addresses prior to registering users and/or sending a confirmation
    email.

INSTALLATION
    To install this package, uncompress the distribution, change to the
    directory where the files are present and type:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install

USE
    To use the module in your programs you will use the line:

            use Net::ValidMX;

  check_valid_mx
    To check if an email address could be valid by checking the DNS, call
    the function check_valid_mx with the email address as the only argument:

            &Net::validMX::check_valid_mx('kevin.mcgrail@thoughtworthy.com');

  EXAMPLE
    The distribution contains an example program suitable to demonstrate
    working functionality and to query one or more email addresses.

    Without any parameters, it will run a set of default tests:

            perl examples/check_primary_mx.pl

    Otherwise, run the program with the email addresses to test as your
    arguments:

            perl examples/check_primary_mx.pl kevin.mcgrail@thoughtworthy.com

TODO
    - I'd like to convert the example script into a test script.
    - I'd like to make it so that the Makefile.PL creates a README on the
    fly from the pod in the library instead of pod2text lib/Net/validMX.pm >
    README.
